# Eddy (next generation)

Eddy is a Discord chatbot you can interact with.

/!\ It does NOT answer to what you are asking him : it only generates a sentence based on what you said to him previously /!\

## How to train

Create a file for training in which you create a markov decision chain (with the module I used), and save it into model.json

Then you can just talk to the bot for the training.

## How to start

You need to set these env. variables : 
PREFIX - the default prefix of the bot \n
TOKEN  - discord bot token
